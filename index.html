    <p>I am a trans girl who uses it/she pronouns and I am a changeling who also likes being in its pony form, specifically a pegas pony form.</p>
    <p>When I say that I´m a changeling, I mean it :3 I´m what´s called an otherkin or therian! An individual who doesnt identify as human.</p>
    <p>And also I´m inside a plural system of 4, including me there are 4 people in this brain. Their names are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/therix.bsky.social">Therix</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/roseprotogen.bsky.social">Rose</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pridejane.bsky.social">Jane</a>.</p>
    <p>My hobbies and interests include worldbuilding, gaming, coding, conlanging, drawing, math, My Little Pony, Mars, aliens and more!</p>
    <p>I really like understanding different people and I try to be as kind as I can!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I speak Slovak, English and toki pona</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am bisexual but more specifically finsexual (attraction to feminine people of any gender, though of course femininity is subjective and me being attracted to you doesnt mean you are a girl)</p>
